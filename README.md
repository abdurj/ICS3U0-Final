# Skelly-Run
Skelly Run is a 5-Stage 2D Platformer game developed using LibGDX and the Box2D library in Kotlin. The player can progress through all 5 levels increasing in difficulty by simply playing through the levels and defeating all enemies before walking into the teleporter at the end of the level. The game also features a secret speed run mode, where the player can try to finish the game as fast as possible by simply shooting the portal at the end of the level instead of walking into it, bypassing the requirement to defeat all the enemies to progress.
